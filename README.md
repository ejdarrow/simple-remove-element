# Simple Remove Element

Extensions that can read data on all websites are scary. I needed a simple way to remove elements from pages but I didn't want to use an extension that isn't:

1. Open-source
2. Secure
3. Efficient
4. Auditable

This extension satisfies these requirements.

Once I publish this extension I'll link the crexcavator report here.
